# Bank Transaction Analyzer

A memory-efficient Streamlit application that analyzes PDF bank statements to detect refunds, duplicate payments, and financial losses with comprehensive Excel reporting and batch processing capabilities.

## Features

- **PDF Processing**: Extract transaction data from multiple bank statement PDFs
- **Batch Processing**: Memory-efficient processing of large datasets
- **Refund Detection**: Automatically match debits with corresponding credits
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify potential duplicate payments using fuzzy matching
- **Excel Reporting**: Generate color-coded Excel reports with multiple worksheets
- **Real-time Progress**: Progress bars for large file processing
- **Configurable Analysis**: Adjustable parameters for duplicate detection and similarity matching

## Local Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bank-transaction-analyzer
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r setup_requirements.txt
   ```

   Or install packages individually:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit>=1.28.0
   pip install pdfplumber>=0.9.0
   pip install openpyxl>=3.1.0
   pip install psutil>=5.9.0
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Streamlit application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run simple_app.py
   ```

2. **Access the application**
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`
   - The application will automatically open in your default browser

### Configuration Options

The application provides several configuration options in the sidebar:

#### Performance Settings
- **Batch Processing Size**: Controls memory usage vs processing speed
  - Smaller batches (50-100): Lower memory usage, slower processing
  - Larger batches (500-1000): Higher memory usage, faster processing

#### Analysis Parameters
- **Duplicate Detection Window**: Number of days to look for duplicate transactions (1-14 days)
- **Amount Difference Threshold**: Maximum amount difference to consider as duplicate (₦1-₦10,000)
- **Name Matching Threshold**: Similarity percentage for beneficiary name matching (50-100%)

## Usage Guide

### Step 1: Upload Bank Statements
- Click "Choose PDF bank statement files"
- Select multiple PDF files from the same bank
- Supported format: Standard Nigerian bank statement PDFs

### Step 2: Configure Analysis
- Adjust batch size based on your system's memory capacity
- Set duplicate detection parameters according to your needs
- Configure name matching sensitivity

### Step 3: Analyze Transactions
- Click "Analyze Transactions"
- Monitor progress bars for large files
- Wait for analysis completion

### Step 4: Review Results
The application provides multiple views:

- **Summary Metrics**: Total transactions, debits, refunds, and estimated losses
- **Refunds Tab**: Transactions that were later credited back
- **Duplicates Tab**: Suspected duplicate payments grouped together
- **All Transactions Tab**: Complete transaction listing

### Step 5: Download Report
- Click "Download Excel Report" to get a comprehensive report
- The Excel file contains multiple color-coded worksheets:
  - All Transactions (complete data)
  - Refunded Transactions (green highlighting)
  - Suspected Duplicates (yellow highlighting)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Errors with Large Files**
   - Reduce batch processing size in sidebar
   - Process fewer PDF files at once
   - Close other memory-intensive applications

2. **PDF Parsing Errors**
   - Ensure PDFs are not password-protected
   - Verify PDFs contain readable text (not scanned images)
   - Try processing files individually to identify problematic PDFs

3. **Slow Processing**
   - Increase batch processing size if memory allows
   - Ensure sufficient available RAM
   - Consider processing files in smaller groups

### Performance Optimization

- **For Small Files** (< 50 pages): Use batch size 500-1000
- **For Medium Files** (50-200 pages): Use batch size 200-500
- **For Large Files** (> 200 pages): Use batch size 50-200
- **For Systems with Limited Memory**: Always use batch size 50-100

### System Requirements

- **Minimum RAM**: 4GB
- **Recommended RAM**: 8GB or more
- **Storage**: 1GB free space for temporary processing
- **CPU**: Modern multi-core processor recommended for large datasets

## Data Privacy

- All processing is done locally on your machine
- No data is sent to external servers
- PDF files and generated reports remain on your local system
- Application does not store or transmit any transaction data

## Support

For technical issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify all requirements are properly installed
3. Ensure PDF files are in a supported format
4. Try processing with smaller batch sizes
